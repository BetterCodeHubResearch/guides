<em class="t-gray">Learn how RubyGems works, and how to make your own.</em>

The RubyGems software allows you to easily 
download, install, and use ruby software packages on your system.  The
software package is called a "gem" and contains a package Ruby
application or library.

Gems can be used to extend or modify
functionality in Ruby applications.  Commonly they're used to distribute
reusable functionality that is shared with other Rubyists for use in
their applications and libraries.  Some gems provide command line
utilities to help automate tasks and speed up your work.
